- Saves cleaned data as CSV
## Project Purpose

This project demonstrates basic data engineering skills such as:

- Creating and cleaning customer data using Python  
- Performing simple data analysis (churn rate calculation)  
- Simulating an ETL workflow by saving cleaned data to CSV

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x).  
2. Install pandas library if you donâ€™t have it:  
   `pip install pandas`  
3. Run the script from terminal or command prompt:
